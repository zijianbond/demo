worldnews,2024-10-17 18:58:05,TheTelegraph,"Russian devices that catch fire are 'undetectable' by airport scanners, security expert warns","Terrorist nation does terrorism. Business as usal with Russia || From The Telegraph: 

  
Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || Pagers?"

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration.

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

And if yes, who can join on Ukraines side? || With North Korea supplying half of Russia's artillery and now boots on the ground, effectively Ukraine is at war with North Korea. Then we have Iran supplying long-range missiles to Russia. If Ukraine loses its not simply a defeat for Ukraine, its a victory for authoritarianism and shows how pathetically weak the west and democracy is. || It’s time to lift restrictions on Ukraine’s use of weapons. The only way to end this war is to let them bloody Putin’s nose by striking military targets and maybe his bunkers a couple times. 

Let the son-of-a-bitch know that he should stay in his bunker. || World: best we can do is no response"

Putin will pay eventually. Go on, play chess with the souls of your purchased 10,000 incapable men. Watch them die. Then what?

Swear to god, if the Russians even think about using a nuke EVER, he needs to be disappeared and the country subdued, aka WW3. Fuck these insane men playing chess with all of our destinies.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

No issue from France with that, of course. || Let me guess, people genuinely think if Israel had a  ceasefire and gave into Hamas´s demands then all the hostage would have magically come back and there would be peace

Israel is absolutely heavy handed and worthy of criticism, as all countries are, but France doesnt really have a solid legacy to stand on here. || It's crazy all the onus is always on Israel to stop fighting. I don't know any other country that gets shit for defending itself against attacks. || Probably is afraid of them competing with France’s domestic industries.
