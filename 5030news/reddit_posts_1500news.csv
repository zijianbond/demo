Least this guy doesn't dispute his guilt. || I don’t have issues with the death penalty when the person acknowledges they committed the crime(s). However, I feel like life without the possibility of parole is a worse punishment. || He blamed the wrong substance/addiction. Should have blamed religion, like an angel/verse from book told him to kill them or something. He would go scot-free. || Before anyone starts to celebrate this, I want to remind everyone that the state of Alabama does not currently have a humane method of carrying out the death penalty. The state does not have access to sufficient medications required for lethal injection and botched the executions carried out earlier this year using nitrogen gas.

Regardless of individual feelings about the death penalty, the State of Alabama should not be allowed to carry out death sentences until they remediate those issues with their execution methods and ensure they do not violate the 8th Amendment.

ETA: I am personally against the death penalty, but I especially am against it when the state cannot enact it without botching it. || The state should never be executing someone. Abolish the death penalty."

I can’t find the article I’m thinking of, but it was written by or focused on a dude whose PhD thesis was about the student loan debt in the US. I think he was an assistant for betsy? maybe? before he quit.

The projection is that only 25% of the $1.75T is ever going to be repaid… that’s excluding all the programs and forgiveness, and whatever.

College tuitions are up another ~2.3% across the board and there is still zero risk analysis about lending to students whose parents just said “go to college and get a job”.

This approval is a good thing, but it’s not a silver bullet. The system for loaning out taxpayer dollars for higher education is broken and nobody in office wants to fix it because it’s less money in their pockets.

This is a step in the right direction, but this is like taking ibuprofen for a broken arm. Some people will be in less pain for a little while, but it does nothing to address the root cause. || I don't think people in these comments realize that this headline is talking about ALL of the loan forgiveness that Biden has approved during his presidency. This isn't a single new wave of forgiveness, just some additional that has brought the total up to $175 billion. || As someone whose taxes go towards this and does not benefit from this, I truly hope this goes through.

We are a wealthy enough country that education should not be gatekept by an individual's financial situation. || ELI5 questions - so the student loan lien holders get paid out, and banks get their 100% cut.  Why aren’t the bankruptcy laws attacked?  Or are they being attacked now?  I mean would a simple fix to the whole student loan thing be … allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy?  There should always be a risk to lending, and if banks lose out, then boo f-ing hoo.  Banks go under, and taxpayers have FDIC. Banks don’t seem to have any real consequences for risky behavior. "

Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

One of them was interviewed and she said ""we don't prisoners. We kill every ISIS member we come across"" || >Seydou was just 11 when she was kidnapped by Islamic State fighters who stormed her home area of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, killing men and abducting thousands of young women and girls.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

What this woman went through is horrifying, but it is not out of the ordinary for what Yazidi women have gone through over the past decade or more.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

I'm sure someone smarter than me can fill in the casual viewer || To anyone outside the space industry, this is massive. Not just because it’s an insane engineering feat, but what it does for space launch

Starship does the following (assuming they can successfully also land the second stage on future attempts):

•	⁠brings down launch costs down by another order of magnitude. This is after falcon 9 (F9) already dramatically reduced launch costs. Starship is advertised to be in the $200/kg range to low earth orbit. That is basically free in space terms

•	⁠larger fairing. Remember how the James Webb telescope had to be unfolded in space? That was because they had to make it smaller to fit on a launch vehicle. This adds insane cost and complexity. Starship has a much bigger fairing, reducing the need for unfolding and complexity (reduce, not eliminate)


•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

•	⁠starlink can launch bigger satellites, enabling them to have better bandwidth. You know the articles about starlink speeds have declined? Well this the answer
•	⁠reusable second stage - first ever (I believe). This is future tense and hasn’t been proven yet || Successful touchdown in the ocean of the ship as well. || What's the advantage of this vs. their current landing method? Insanely cool engineering regardless."

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.


>Alberto Crescenti, head of the Buenos Aires public emergency medical services, said Payne fell about 14 metres into a courtyard of the hotel. Mr Crescenti said there was ""no possibility of resuscitation"" by the time authorities arrived at the scene.

Most of their stores survive on the pharmacy, but all the tech in their pharmacy (as of around 8 years ago) was ancient, like 20+ years out of date, not just 20 years old. They cobbled together enough system adaptation to barely exist to modern standards, and the number and time of outages they have is astounding. 

On top of that, they short staff their pharmacies and expect retail employees to fill in  at the pharmacy during busy hours. They short staff retail as well, so things look like garbage up front because there are not enough people available to keep things moving.

Afterwards, call the utility/police/etc company phone number publicly available online or in your known phone numbers to verify the rep (make sure to have a lookout in case there's a second burglar hiding behind the house).

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.

Ask for their name and some form of ID and respond saying you will contact the customer service line of the company.  Afterwards, call the utility/police/etc company phone number publicly available online or in your known phone numbers to verify the rep (make sure to have a lookout in case there's a second burglar hiding behind the house).

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

“It wasn’t random,” Bouchard said. “They’re not just knocking on doors and doing this.” || saw this story over the weekend, so sad and heartbreaking.

> A grand jury in Robertson County issued an indictment Monday that accused Fields of shooting her mother, Trudy Fields, in the head and stabbing her multiple times before dismembering her corpse. She was also indicted on a charge of killing a dog.
> 
> A judge set Fields’ bond at $1.5 million on Monday. Fields does not yet have an attorney, so the judge ordered that she be assigned a public defender, The Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
> 
> Trudy Fields was killed between Oct. 8 and 9, the indictment said.
> 
> Torilena Fields refused to come out of the house after police found her mother’s body, which was in the backyard near a bloody mattress.

We kill every ISIS member we come across"" || >Seydou was just 11 when she was kidnapped by Islamic State fighters who stormed her home area of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, killing men and abducting thousands of young women and girls.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.  The authorities now have a starting point for their investigation. || But no one has been arrested yet. Weird. Seems open and shut. She was living with her grandma until 2004, then moved into the house with her mom and disappeared a year later."

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

> 
> Trudy Fields was killed between Oct. 8 and 9, the indictment said.
> 
> Torilena Fields refused to come out of the house after police found her mother’s body, which was in the backyard near a bloody mattress.

We kill every ISIS member we come across"" || >Seydou was just 11 when she was kidnapped by Islamic State fighters who stormed her home area of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, killing men and abducting thousands of young women and girls.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

What this woman went through is horrifying, but it is not out of the ordinary for what Yazidi women have gone through over the past decade or more.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The crew refused to open the lower deck until the vessel was sinking. When they finally opened the hatch, it was too late: 331 people died.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

We kill every ISIS member we come across"" || >Seydou was just 11 when she was kidnapped by Islamic State fighters who stormed her home area of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, killing men and abducting thousands of young women and girls.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

What this woman went through is horrifying, but it is not out of the ordinary for what Yazidi women have gone through over the past decade or more.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

Starship does the following (assuming they can successfully also land the second stage on future attempts):

•	⁠larger fairing. Remember how the James Webb telescope had to be unfolded in space? That was because they had to make it smaller to fit on a launch vehicle. This adds insane cost and complexity. Starship has a much bigger fairing, reducing the need for unfolding and complexity (reduce, not eliminate)


•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

•	⁠starlink can launch bigger satellites, enabling them to have better bandwidth. You know the articles about starlink speeds have declined? Well this the answer

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

I can’t find the article I’m thinking of, but it was written by or focused on a dude whose PhD thesis was about the student loan debt in the US.

College tuitions are up another ~2.3% across the board and there is still zero risk analysis about lending to students whose parents just said “go to college and get a job”.

This approval is a good thing, but it’s not a silver bullet. The system for loaning out taxpayer dollars for higher education is broken and nobody in office wants to fix it because it’s less money in their pockets.

Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

One of them was interviewed and she said ""we don't prisoners. We kill every ISIS member we come across"" || >Seydou was just 11 when she was kidnapped by Islamic State fighters who stormed her home area of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014, killing men and abducting thousands of young women and girls.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

What this woman went through is horrifying, but it is not out of the ordinary for what Yazidi women have gone through over the past decade or more.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

Starship does the following (assuming they can successfully also land the second stage on future attempts):

•	⁠brings down launch costs down by another order of magnitude. This is after falcon 9 (F9) already dramatically reduced launch costs. Starship is advertised to be in the $200/kg range to low earth orbit. That is basically free in space terms

•	⁠larger fairing. Remember how the James Webb telescope had to be unfolded in space? That was because they had to make it smaller to fit on a launch vehicle. This adds insane cost and complexity. Starship has a much bigger fairing, reducing the need for unfolding and complexity (reduce, not eliminate)


•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

•	⁠starlink can launch bigger satellites, enabling them to have better bandwidth. You know the articles about starlink speeds have declined? Well this the answer
•	⁠reusable second stage - first ever (I believe). This is future tense and hasn’t been proven yet || Successful touchdown in the ocean of the ship as well. || What's the advantage of this vs. their current landing method? Insanely cool engineering regardless."

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Thank you Lilly, RIP. || The Lilly Ledbetter act was the very first bill that Obama signed as president || Thank you for your determination Lilly.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

It is not equivalent to a Nobel Prize, nor should it be named as such. || How readable is Why Nations Fail? I.e., does it read like a textbook or more like a Guns Germs and Steel or 1177?"

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.

 — 
Liam Payne, a former member of boyband One Direction, has died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, according to police there. He was 31.

Payne’s death occurred at a hotel on Costa Rica Street in the Palermo neighborhood, according to a statement from police provided to CNN. || Witnesses say this happened shortly after 5 PM in Buenos Aires ... and that Liam had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier — he smashed his laptop, and had to be carried back to his room.

Liam revealed in June 2021 that he struggled with alcohol and prescription drug addictions at one point when One Direction was on tour, and things got so bad he had “severe” suicidal thoughts.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.


>Alberto Crescenti, head of the Buenos Aires public emergency medical services, said Payne fell about 14 metres into a courtyard of the hotel. Mr Crescenti said there was ""no possibility of resuscitation"" by the time authorities arrived at the scene.

Most of their stores survive on the pharmacy, but all the tech in their pharmacy (as of around 8 years ago) was ancient, like 20+ years out of date, not just 20 years old. They cobbled together enough system adaptation to barely exist to modern standards, and the number and time of outages they have is astounding. 

On top of that, they short staff their pharmacies and expect retail employees to fill in  at the pharmacy during busy hours. They short staff retail as well, so things look like garbage up front because there are not enough people available to keep things moving.

Afterwards, call the utility/police/etc company phone number publicly available online or in your known phone numbers to verify the rep (make sure to have a lookout in case there's a second burglar hiding behind the house).

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.

Earlier this week, there were reports about Liam’s ex-fiancée Maya Henry alleging he’d left her after asking her to get an abortion. Her attorneys had been trying to send him a cease-and-desist letter to stop contacting her.

> ""When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,"" a hotel worker told police, according to audio related to the case Reuters obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.

>The worker added the guest's life was at risk because their room had a balcony.

Ask for their name and some form of ID and respond saying you will contact the customer service line of the company.  Afterwards, call the utility/police/etc company phone number publicly available online or in your known phone numbers to verify the rep (make sure to have a lookout in case there's a second burglar hiding behind the house).

If gas leak is really urgent, the rep would call and bring up the fire or police department ASAP to make sure it is legit. || Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a Michigan home invasion in which the perpetrators are believed to have gained entry by posing as utility workers.

Carlos Jose Hernandez, 37, was arrested on Saturday, according to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with murder, and law enforcement officials are seeking his extradition from Louisiana.

On Monday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested the second suspect, but did not immediately release his identity. He was arrested without incident following a traffic stop in Plymouth Township, Michigan, according to the sheriff’s office.

A 72-year-old man was found dead Friday in the basement of his Rochester Hills home, according to the sheriff’s office. His wife, who called 911, had been tied up with her hands duct-taped.

It is not yet clear how the man, identified as Hussein Murray, was killed.

Because of the gruesome nature of the injuries, it was not immediately clear if he had been shot or bludgeoned to death,” the sheriff’s department said in a press release.

The woman told law enforcement officials that the night before the attack, the two suspects had also shown up to the home claiming to be responding to a gas leak, but they were not allowed inside.

When they showed up again on Friday, they were let into the home, and her husband went with them into the basement, “ostensibly to look for the leak,” according to the sheriff’s. 

When they came back upstairs without her husband, they tied her up and taped her hands, the woman said. She did not see him come out afterward and “assumed he had been kidnapped.”

In home security camera footage released by the sheriff’s department, the since-arrested suspect can be seen wearing a utility worker’s uniform and a mask while holding a clipboard.

“We’re DTE. We’re checking for gas leaks,” the man can be heard saying in the video, naming the Michigan-based energy company.

Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
In a statement after the incident, DTE urged customers to “be alert for DTE Energy impersonators.”

“If anyone arrives at your home or business claiming they are from DTE, please ask to see a badge with a photo ID. If the person refuses to show their badge, do not allow them entry into your home. If the person becomes agitated or acts in a strange manner, call 911 immediately,” the company said.

Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard described Murray as “a loving guy, owned a business, cared about his neighborhood and his community” in an interview with Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

“[He] shouldn’t have been a target of this — no one should ever be a target of this,” Bouchard said.

Murray owned a jewelry and pawn shop, according to WXYZ.

Bouchard said they believe Murray’s killing was “very targeted.”

“It wasn’t random,” Bouchard said. “They’re not just knocking on doors and doing this.” || saw this story over the weekend, so sad and heartbreaking.

> A grand jury in Robertson County issued an indictment Monday that accused Fields of shooting her mother, Trudy Fields, in the head and stabbing her multiple times before dismembering her corpse. She was also indicted on a charge of killing a dog.
> 
> A judge set Fields’ bond at $1.5 million on Monday. Fields does not yet have an attorney, so the judge ordered that she be assigned a public defender, The Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
> 
> Trudy Fields was killed between Oct. 8 and 9, the indictment said.
> 
> Torilena Fields refused to come out of the house after police found her mother’s body, which was in the backyard near a bloody mattress.

>Taken to a slave market in Mosul, she was traded between different Isis fighters and repeatedly raped. After a year she was moved to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was married off to her third captor, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Gaza who she says also belonged to Hamas.

>“He told me that I had to sleep with him,” she said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel Rudaw. “On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and bought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried.

>”The following year she gave birth to a boy, then some time later a daughter.

>In late 2018 her captor was killed in fighting for the Islamic State, which was driven out of its last stronghold by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition. Seydou was transferred to Al-Hawl, a grim camp for Isis wives in the desert of northeast Syria where as many as 100 Yazidi women still remain.

>Her captor’s brother was also in Isis and in 2020 he arranged to get her and the children out through Turkey to Egypt and through tunnels to Gaza. Desperate to escape the camp, and thinking her own family dead, she agreed.

>But once in Rafah she says the family were so abusive, forcing her to clean and cook and regularly beating her, that at one point she took an overdose, ending up in hospital.

>Eventually, last September, she made the TikTok video asking someone to contact Nadia Murad, the Nobel peace prizewinning Yazidi activist. “HELP me,” she pleaded. “I’m really tired, it’s not just their men, their women and children also harass me … They might assault me, KILL me … it’s really overwhelming.

>”It was picked up by a Kurdish TV channel, which interviewed her. The story was seen by her mother who had long assumed her daughter was dead.

news,2024-10-14 15:19:27,Horse_Named_Apollo,Nobel economics prize is awarded for research into how poor institutions affect countries’ success,"Well deserved. 

The importance of institutions explains a hell of a lot of economic differences in a number of different arenas. || Super well deserved.

For a short primer, Acemoglu is the central cog in this award. Much of his and James Robinson’s work can be summarized by their book Why Nations Fail. These three revived much of the thinking about institutions, which had been cast by the wayside by economists for years.

Acemoglu and Robinson (Simon Johnson contributed to several papers also) argue that institutions- the existing social and legal norms, are essential for democracy, economic growth, and the welfare of the populace. Acemoglu and Robinson classify institutional frameworks: inclusive institutions protect the property rights of the entire society (not just the elite) and allow all peoples to participate in the economy: extractive institutions prevent everyone except for the elite from benefitting from economic participation and may confiscate the property of those who aren’t the elite. This work also shows the long-standing effects of colonialism (an extractive practice) on the developing world, and argues that practices done over a century ago can still play a role in current economics and politics.

If you want to dig further into this, I’d suggest the three authors’ paper “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”. 

These three give the best answer to arguably the most fundamental question in economics: why are some countries rich, and others are poor? And why do some countries *stay* rich and others stay poor? The answer may be institutions. These winners are big for the study of long-run economics development (which wasn’t really a thing until AJR started studying it) and another win for economic history. And it further legitimizes the further study of the long-run effects of colonialism, which were virtually ignored by everyone but heterodox economists. 

Daron Acemoglu has been on the Nobel radar for years now, and for good reason. He earned his PhD at 25 and was tenured at MIT at age 31. He’s one of the most cited economists in history, and there’s a good chance if you take a development economics class, you’ve probably read something by him. He has been cited almost 250,000 times. A productive economist at a major research university will usually produce 5 papers a year- the best paper of their career will usually have somewhere around 750 citations. A paper with 1,000 citations is considered an important contribution. Acemoglu has **56** publications with over 1,000 citations. 

There’s even arguments that he should win the Nobel Prize *again* because this doesn’t cover  many aspects of his other research involving technology and economic growth, the effects of new technology (including generative AI) on socioeconomic inequality, the relationship between technological change and inequality, it’s goes on and on.

We do also need to talk about Robinson and Johnson, because their works shouldn’t be overshadowed by Acemoglu. Robinson becomes the first true political scientist to win the Nobel Prize in economics and helped revive and re-popularize interdisciplinary “conflict studies”, further showing that good economic research can be found outside of an economics department. Simon Johnson is primarily a macroeconomist (he is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund) whose body of work is more geared toward corruption and inflation, but he also contributed heavily on several of the papers of Acemoglu and Robinson- sometimes it takes a good team.

There are some critiques to AJR (and not just the bullshit “this isn’t *really* a Nobel). Many of Acemoglu’s early papers do not hold up to the more stringent standards of modern econometrics, and the IV framework of “Colonial Origins of Comparative Development” is a bit questionable. That doesn’t necessarily diminish the contribution- after all, we can’t hold a paper published in 2001 to the standards of 2024. There are other critiques that AJR’s model has trouble explaining China’s economic growth- China isn’t democratic, does not have strong established property rights, but still achieves economic growth. There are also critiques that AJR’s work rely heavily on theoretical models with limited econometric support (described by CUNY economist Branko Milanovic as “Wikipedia with regressions”). But then again, these assumptions are necessary to study long-run growth. It’s better to make some judgement calls and make extrapolations based on the data we have than to not bother studying something at all.  

TLDR: Good institutions can drive economic growth and improve democracy. Bad institutions hamper growth and democracy. || What’s an example of a poor institution? || Obligatory reminder that Alfred Nobel did not actually create a Nobel Prize of Economics and that this is the “Nobel Memorial” prize of economics.

Alfred Nobel didn’t give economics a prize and this was a posthumous creation by a bunch of economists at the Swedish Bank wanting to pat themselves on the back and they decided to name it after him. The correct name in full is “The Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”.

•	⁠larger fairing. Remember how the James Webb telescope had to be unfolded in space? That was because they had to make it smaller to fit on a launch vehicle. This adds insane cost and complexity.

•	⁠massive amount of capacity. Starship is yuggggee. launch is a bottleneck.

Sat 12 Oct 2024 10.46 EDT

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. || This is why he started saying “Kamala is going to go after me”.

Edit: the home was owned by her bio mom.  Fucking awful. || GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) – Authorities in Colorado have identified recently sold remains that were found stored in a freezer nearly 10 months ago.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said the grim discovery was made shortly after a home in Grand Junction had been sold in January.

According to deputies, the remains of a human head and set of hands were found by someone who arrived to claim the freezer, which was being offered for free by the new owner of the recently sold property.

Investigators have confirmed the remains belong to Amanda Leariel Overstreet, a girl who had not been heard from since April 2005.


They estimate she was around 16 years old at the time of her disappearance.

“I mean, she was a child. She was 16 years old. She was still a child,” Wendy Likes, information and communications manager for the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, said.

According to the sheriff’s office, Overstreet was the biological daughter of the previous owner of the property where her remains were found.

Neighbor Jameson Perez said there was a foul smell coming from the house when he would walk by. He also shared that the last time he saw the little girl was when she was on her way to school.


Police records indicate Overstreet was never reported missing.

The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office is continuing its investigation. || Just spooky a child - or anyone - can disappear off the face of the earth with no questions asked. We all need someone looking out for us, just sad this girl didn't have even her family to do that for her. || No word on where Amanda's parents went after selling their home.  The authorities now have a starting point for their investigation. || But no one has been arrested yet. Weird. Seems open and shut. She was living with her grandma until 2004, then moved into the house with her mom and disappeared a year later."
