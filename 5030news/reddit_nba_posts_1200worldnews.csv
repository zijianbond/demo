worldnews,2024-10-17 18:58:05,TheTelegraph,"Russian devices that catch fire are 'undetectable' by airport scanners, security expert warns","Terrorist nation does terrorism. Business as usal with Russia || From The Telegraph: 

  
Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || Pagers?"

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration.

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || Pagers?"

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

Chinaś tariffs are on the low side at [around 6.7% overall. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/china-lowers-trade-barriers-for-other-countries-amid-us-tensions.html)

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:  

¨This trade deficit is driven by a difference in saving rates between the US and China: Chinese households save more than 30 percent of disposable income on average, compared to 7 percent in the United States.¨

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war

Moreover, the accusations of ¨stealing intellectual property¨ are absolutely racist trash. The silicon solar photovoltaic cell was invented in 1954 and the patents had expired decades before the Chinese began manufacturing solar panels. That is not stealing. Nor were LFP batteries a stolen technology. Again, the patents had expired. 

The fact is that these convenient excuses for hating on China happen to benefit the oil industry in particular and that is an industry that has bipartisan support in the United States. No wonder we see lock-step unity on this stomping down of renewable energy under the clever banner of race baiting coming from both the Red and Blue teams."

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class.

We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring. 
Which is how I like my politics. || There should be no doubt that ruzzia is meddling with our democracy. This should be taken seriously whether you vote conservative or not, love Trudeau or not.

In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

EDIT: Of course two heterosexual couples with one infertile partner each can also help each other, which is also blocked now. || [removed]"

>Warsaw’s planned acquisitions from South Korea include K2 Black Panther tanks, K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers, FA-50 light combat aircraft and Chunmoo multiple rocket launch systems. The two countries initially signed a $12.4 billion defense deal in 2022, the MND stated, with an additional contract signed in 2023 for the K9 Thunder howitzer. In late April 2024, Poland’s National Defense Ministry signed a $1.6 billion contract to buy 72 HOMAR-K launchers from South Korea-based Hanwha Aerospace, Reuters reported.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

> The U.K. is considering imposing sanctions on two extremist Israeli ministers, Keir Starmer confirmed Wednesday.

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

> The threat was dismissed by Ben Gvir, who wrote: “The British need to know the days of their mandate are over. “In any case, they do not scare me, and I will continue to only act according to the important national interests of the State of Israel.”

> The U.K. imposed new sanctions Tuesday targeting three outposts including Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost and four organizations.

> Lammy said the “extremist Israeli settlers” had perpetrated “heinous abuses of human rights” against Palestinians and the Israeli government allowed “impunity to flourish.”"

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

Lol, bs. There have been several denounces that many of them are armed, and have attacked people who [doesn't want to be part of the protest](https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/incidentes-la-unr-dos-detenidos-agredir-un-militante-libertario-n10159041.html). 

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration. But we know that it wasn't a coincidence, the same way it wasn't a coincidence that computers and wheels get stolen meanwhile they were protesting. Either the thieves knew who's car or faculty they were stealing from, or it was all too a huge coincidence only our faculty and engineering got their stuff stolen."

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog.

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || I can‘t comprehend the amount of evil things Russia gets away with.

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

Staffing levels in Russia in the third quarter of 2024 hit a record low for the entire history of observations.

Russian manufacturing enterprises producing investment and consumer goods continue to experience the most acute staffing shortages. 

Plans among Russian companies for hiring in the fourth quarter have also become more cautious, although they still intend to increase the size of their workforce.

The number of enterprises facing staffing deficits continues to rise, and it remains unclear what might reverse this trend, especially in light of the decision to increase military personnel.

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard highlighted the significant threat these vessels pose to the marine environment.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Again, not like this, but it’s such a dark comedy mess at this point no wonder most people reduce it to simple things to scream out at protests or completely give up on caring."

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:06:47,hernannadal,Argentina: Milei downplays tensions with universities as students occupy dozens,">While the occupations themselves have been peaceful

Lol, bs. There have been several denounces that many of them are armed, and have attacked people who [doesn't want to be part of the protest](https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/incidentes-la-unr-dos-detenidos-agredir-un-militante-libertario-n10159041.html). 

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration. But we know that it wasn't a coincidence, the same way it wasn't a coincidence that computers and wheels get stolen meanwhile they were protesting. Either the thieves knew who's car or faculty they were stealing from, or it was all too a huge coincidence only our faculty and engineering got their stuff stolen."

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring. 
Which is how I like my politics. || There should be no doubt that ruzzia is meddling with our democracy. This should be taken seriously whether you vote conservative or not, love Trudeau or not.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || I can‘t comprehend the amount of evil things Russia gets away with.

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

One was convicted of Class B, basically for failing to uphold the conventions of war and failing to stop those under his command from committing the Nanking massacre.

Iran is against Azerbaijan and on Armenia's side because of that, Armenia has also France and maybe the US on their side. Azerbaijan has Turkey on their side, a NATO country, as well as Israel in terms of arms supply. Mostly because of the animosity between Iran and Azerbaijan. Turkey is on their side because of some nationalistic and cultural pan-turcic views and of course for economic reasons. Russia has disappointed Armenia by not stepping in, when Azerbaijan came for Karabagh, but who knows what they would do when this would escalate further.

Armenia is between a rock and a hard place, and it's a shame for this old nation.

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || Personally now we know I would take any western jet being downed in this way as an act of war and immediately and without warning annihilate all Russian forces in Ukraine."

He wanted to get certified to fly a T6 owned by the memorial flight he helps with and he found it a major challenge, despite his experience.  Now imagine a young pilot in WWII who's only prior experience was in a biplane like the Stearman, or perhaps even a civilian biplane. || I can only add a few comments:

1. Sadness for the loss of life.
2. All military planes are harder to fly than civilian ones, and the Texan was the trainer for very tricky single-seater fighter planes like the Mustang and the Spitfire.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

The industrial revolution would be the last major event. We were literally using so much water, we could chart the changes by observing droughts in the Southern Hemisphere caused by Europe's spreading Industrial Revolution.

The 1930s and the New Deal saw the government create thousands of miles of paved roads, dams and hydroelectric power. The changes to the regional water cycle in places like the Pacific Northwest alter the flow of thousands of miles of river, created reservoirs that otherwise would exist, etc. Those actions directly effected the seasonal flow patterns of water run off, causing all sorts of issues with fish, water tables, and forest habitat. || Great filter here we come. || If there's anything I can be confident about it's that the worlds' governments will do absolutely fuck all about it. i'm glad I don't have kids "

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

EDIT: Of course two heterosexual couples with one infertile partner each can also help each other, which is also blocked now. || [removed]"

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies.

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || Personally now we know I would take any western jet being downed in this way as an act of war and immediately and without warning annihilate all Russian forces in Ukraine."

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

Lol, bs. There have been several denounces that many of them are armed, and have attacked people who [doesn't want to be part of the protest](https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/incidentes-la-unr-dos-detenidos-agredir-un-militante-libertario-n10159041.html). 

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration. But we know that it wasn't a coincidence, the same way it wasn't a coincidence that computers and wheels get stolen meanwhile they were protesting. Either the thieves knew who's car or faculty they were stealing from, or it was all too a huge coincidence only our faculty and engineering got their stuff stolen."

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog.

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

Plans among Russian companies for hiring in the fourth quarter have also become more cautious, although they still intend to increase the size of their workforce.

The number of enterprises facing staffing deficits continues to rise, and it remains unclear what might reverse this trend, especially in light of the decision to increase military personnel.

At the same time, symbolically, the capacity utilisation of enterprises in Russia declined to 80.4% in the third quarter, close to the record high of 80.7% at the end of 2023. || Can’t wait for Putin to request another ten thousand North Koreans to use as workers next. || Russia sent hundreds of thousands of its workers to their deaths and many more left the country to save themselves.

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard highlighted the significant threat these vessels pose to the marine environment. The findings made by journalists illustrate it well.  || Russia don't care because they're now a pariah. || And nothing is done about it. || [removed] || Old man shits all over the streets vibes."

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Again, not like this, but it’s such a dark comedy mess at this point no wonder most people reduce it to simple things to scream out at protests or completely give up on caring."

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:06:47,hernannadal,Argentina: Milei downplays tensions with universities as students occupy dozens,">While the occupations themselves have been peaceful

Lol, bs. There have been several denounces that many of them are armed, and have attacked people who [doesn't want to be part of the protest](https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/incidentes-la-unr-dos-detenidos-agredir-un-militante-libertario-n10159041.html). 

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration. But we know that it wasn't a coincidence, the same way it wasn't a coincidence that computers and wheels get stolen meanwhile they were protesting. Either the thieves knew who's car or faculty they were stealing from, or it was all too a huge coincidence only our faculty and engineering got their stuff stolen."

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring. 
Which is how I like my politics. || There should be no doubt that ruzzia is meddling with our democracy. This should be taken seriously whether you vote conservative or not, love Trudeau or not.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || I can‘t comprehend the amount of evil things Russia gets away with.

A joint investigation by Politico and the nonprofit journalism group SourceMaterial has uncovered at least nine instances of oil spills caused by Russian shadow fleet vessels in international waters since 2021.

Source: Brussels-based politics and policy news organisation Politico, as reported by European Pravda

Details: Journalists used satellite images from the NGO SkyTruth and cross-referenced them with shipping data from Lloyd's List and the commodities platform Kpler. They identified oil leaks tied to Russia's shadow fleet in various locations around the world, including Thailand, Vietnam, Italy and Mexico.

The investigation revealed that these tankers have traversed busy shipping corridors such as the Red Sea and the Panama Canal, posing a potential risk to international trade routes in the event of a serious accident.

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

*“We initiated legislative amendments that create favorable conditions for developing defense industry projects in Lithuania, which has attracted the attention of major global defense companies,” Kuročkina said.*

*She added that Lithuania has already attracted German defense industry giant Rheinmetall to build an ammunition factory and reached an agreement with US defense giant Northrop Grumman for ammunition production.*

*The ministry initiated legislative amendments this year to expedite the start of defense industry projects in Lithuania. Due to simplified procedures resulting from these amendments, the construction of this factory could begin as early as next year.*"

Iran is against Azerbaijan and on Armenia's side because of that, Armenia has also France and maybe the US on their side. Azerbaijan has Turkey on their side, a NATO country, as well as Israel in terms of arms supply. Mostly because of the animosity between Iran and Azerbaijan. Turkey is on their side because of some nationalistic and cultural pan-turcic views and of course for economic reasons. Russia has disappointed Armenia by not stepping in, when Azerbaijan came for Karabagh, but who knows what they would do when this would escalate further.

Armenia is between a rock and a hard place, and it's a shame for this old nation.

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:48:28,VictorEmmanuelIV,NATO cannot confirm reports of N.Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine,"They would be the super skinny ones who speak korean. || NATO has yet to confirm reports that North Korean military personnel are participating in hostilities on Russia’s side against Ukraine, but it is clear that North Korea is fueling Russia’s war effort, while the deepening of its military cooperation with Russia causes deep concern.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

As already reported, a two-day NATO defense ministerial kicks off in Brussels on Thursday, where one of the main issues on the agenda will be continued support for Ukraine. As expected, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, will attend the meeting. ||  NATO is gonna wake up when it's already too late. || How come NATO can't, but all these newspapers can? various news outlets have sources that state that they are using North Korean soldiers in battle. || This really isn’t how it is in actuality but to the average person who barely understands like me or cares things are looking like; 
North Korea is kinda at war with Ukraine now, and by proxy the US, so the US is also defending South Korea by proxy… kinda? Meanwhile everyone is threatening multiple red lines and war is being decried everywhere.

But at the end of the day brainwashed Russians and utterly indoctrinated Koreans are mulching themselves against utterly done Ukrainians defending their right to exist all because an old ex KGB agent with delusions of grandeur thinks he would be next great Tsar?

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class.

We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report.

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies. Its other senior members include executives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Mobile, Huawei, Geely Auto and Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech arm.* || To be fair, I too am skeptical about the Intel Management Engine."

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || I can‘t comprehend the amount of evil things Russia gets away with.

> The U.K. is considering imposing sanctions on two extremist Israeli ministers, Keir Starmer confirmed Wednesday.

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

> Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed Tuesday the last, Conservative government had been working on sanctions against the two “extreme” ministers before July’s general election put the plans on hold. “I couldn’t do them during the election period because I think it was too much of a political act was the advice I received,” he told the BBC.

> The threat was dismissed by Ben Gvir, who wrote: “The British need to know the days of their mandate are over. “In any case, they do not scare me, and I will continue to only act according to the important national interests of the State of Israel.”

> The U.K. imposed new sanctions Tuesday targeting three outposts including Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost and four organizations.

> Lammy said the “extremist Israeli settlers” had perpetrated “heinous abuses of human rights” against Palestinians and the Israeli government allowed “impunity to flourish.”"

*Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian company to construct a new-generation RDX explosives factory in Lithuania, as reported by Lithuania’s Ministry of Economy and Innovation on 16 October.*

Many in the Baltic States fear that if Ukraine falls, Russia could target them next. The explosives factory project aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, Lithuania, and Europe. Construction of the factory is expected to begin in 2025, as per the report. RDX has been widely used in ammunition production, and is known for its superior properties compared to many modern explosives, including extremely fast detonation time, high explosive power, and sensitivity.*

*Minister of Economy and Innovation Aušrinė Armonaitė stated, “We are actively developing cooperation with our partner Ukraine in the defense sector. The new explosives factory in Lithuania is a clear signal to the aggressor that we will not back down.”*

*The global RDX explosives market is rapidly expanding, with the market value reaching approximately 10 billion US dollars in 2023. Projections suggest the market will grow to 13 billion US dollars by 2028 due to increasing demand for this explosive material, according to the report.*

*Lithuania’s Vice Economy Minister Erika Kuročkina emphasized that the new-generation plant built by Ukrainians in Lithuania will significantly contribute to the country’s defense sector development. In recent years, the ministry has taken steps to create favorable conditions for defense industry companies and attract foreign investors to the sector.*

The Trump Administration insisted that tariffs would reduce the trade imbalance with China but this was never the case because:

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring. 
Which is how I like my politics. || There should be no doubt that ruzzia is meddling with our democracy. This should be taken seriously whether you vote conservative or not, love Trudeau or not.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies.

Russian devices that catch fire in aeroplane baggage holds and airport warehouses are “undetectable” by scanners, a security expert has warned.

Jim Termini, an aviation security consultant who works with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), said that the type of devices found planted on a flight to Britain from Leipzig earlier this year could go undetected by current security processes.

The warning was issued after it emerged that [an incendiary device ignited](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-bomb-on-plane-to-the-uk/) inside a DHL warehouse in Leipzig on July 22.

The package, said to contain consumer electronics alongside a container of liquid, was destined for the UK.

Speaking to The Telegraph’s Ukraine: The Latest podcast, Mr Termini said of these incendiary devices: “We cannot detect them. They are undetectable because of the amount of everyday items that are in there and the things that you are allowed to put in cargo.”

He explained that although airport rules currently allow passengers to carry up to 100ml of liquids through security, some substances such as hydrogen peroxide – used in hair dye – are impossible to rule out altogether.

Similar problems apply to [liquids sent by post](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/15/russia-suspected-parcel-bomb-german-plane-leipzig-disaster/) and carried on aeroplanes, he said.

“It’s taken us 18 years from the liquid bomb plot in 2006 to get where we are \[with the 100ml rule being lifted\] and we just got there, and then these incendiary devices came out the woodwork,” Mr Termini continued.

“For me it’s really concerning because the attack methodology is viable, it’s realistic, it’s cheap, it’s easy.

“The global supply chain is a valid target, as far as the Russians are concerned.” || Based on Russia's reputation, I wont be surprised if these explode before they start shipping out of country || ...intentionally? || I can‘t comprehend the amount of evil things Russia gets away with.

> The prime minister said the government would examine the possibility of sanctioning two far-right Israeli government ministers — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — over past “abhorrent” remarks by the pair.

> Smotrich said in August that the starvation of two million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral” in order to free Israeli hostages. Ben-Gvir praised settlers suspected of killing a Palestinian as “heroes,” and backed protests against aid convoys reaching Gaza.

> The PM repeated his refrain for aid to be allowed into Gaza in far greater volume and for the U.N. given the freedom to operate within the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said later that sanctions were regularly kept under review. “We’ll look into where it is appropriate to go further,” the spokesperson said, adding “We will continue to hold to account those responsible for this violence.”

> During the ruling Labour party’s annual conference in September, Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested sanctions against the ministers could be a possibility. He told a fringe meeting: “If we have to act, we will act,” adding he was in discussion with G7 ministers about the matter.

*The United States will shift its training of Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilots to focus on young cadets rather than experienced military personnel, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 17.*

*This could potentially delay the deployment of a full combat-ready squadron in Ukraine until spring 2025.*

*According to the report, which cites unnamed U.S. officials, the decision is linked to a shortage of experienced Ukrainian pilots with the necessary English language skills who can be pulled from the battlefield. Some officials also believe that younger cadets will be more receptive to Western-style training.*

*Two sources familiar with the pilot training program suggested that a full squadron of 20 F-16s and 40 pilots is unlikely to be operational in Ukraine before spring or summer 2025. The new recruits will spend a year training in the United Kingdom and France before moving on to F-16 courses in Arizona and Romania, the WSJ reported.*

*Meanwhile, experienced pilots may skip basic flight training.*

*""We are still accepting experienced pilots. But there are also those who do not have such training and flying experience,"" a senior Pentagon official told the newspaper. U.S. officials noted that Ukrainian military personnel are facing challenges with certain aspects of the training program, as well as with English language proficiency. Instructors also reported that some pilots with experience on Soviet MiG fighters ""resisted American training methods.""*

*The United States previously accelerated the training course for experienced Ukrainian pilots to six to nine months. Eight cadets completed basic training and moved to a Romanian airbase last month. Another eight experienced pilots are currently completing F-16 training in Arizona and are expected to arrive in Ukraine early next year, according to the WSJ.*

*According to the Ukrainian President’s website, Greece has committed to providing additional resources to accelerate F-16 training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians. This commitment builds upon Greece’s ongoing military support to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, which has included material and technical assistance as well as training.*"

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at today’s press conference in Brussels ahead of the  defense ministerial.

Answering the question of an Ukrinform correspondent, whether the Alliance has information about the ongoing transfer of North Korean troops for their further participation in the war against Ukraine, Rutte said:

“I cannot confirm these reports, but obviously they are concerning. What we do know is that North Korea is helping to fuel Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. And we strongly condemn the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. But at this stage we cannot confirm the reports you have mentioned,” said the head of the Alliance.

He noted that North Korea, in cooperation with China and Iran, is helping Russia in the war. At the same time, Russia also pays for such support, and not always with money, providing its knowledge, insights, innovation, and technology in return.

This two-way movement is not always beneficial to Russia, Mark Rutte argued.

worldnews,2024-10-16 18:06:47,hernannadal,Argentina: Milei downplays tensions with universities as students occupy dozens,">While the occupations themselves have been peaceful

Lol, bs. There have been several denounces that many of them are armed, and have attacked people who [doesn't want to be part of the protest](https://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/incidentes-la-unr-dos-detenidos-agredir-un-militante-libertario-n10159041.html). 

Also, personal story, they always commit violence when we don't want to belong to their protests. I was studying at San Juan Bosco back in 2017-2018, and we had several protests too against Macri. The Faculty of economics and engineering didn't join the protest. Because of that we had a lot of problems, the guys protesting in the entrance of the university usually called us slurs or bump into us as we went to class. Several computers from our faculty got stolen, and some car wheels as well, the guy in security in the parking lot ""didn't saw anything"", and was funny enough the father of one of the guys protesting.

[They even burned one of our class saloons](https://www-adnsur-com-ar.translate.goog/sociedad/queman-parte-de-un-aula-en-la-universidad-san-juan-bosco_a5c7d3de0d21b0e48c95d9536?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Now of course the motive was never reported by the University's administration. But we know that it wasn't a coincidence, the same way it wasn't a coincidence that computers and wheels get stolen meanwhile they were protesting. Either the thieves knew who's car or faculty they were stealing from, or it was all too a huge coincidence only our faculty and engineering got their stuff stolen."

“Do you think the Chinese interference file should have gotten to your desk”

Paraphrase: Well, it wasn’t complete at the time *and* decisions about what I am briefed on is made by the relevant personnel about complete documents - but nothing in that report was revelatory to me. We are aware of all the many ways China is meddling, and I’d been briefed on them all before that report. The report was a great summary, and very useful for anyone new to intelligence work, but nothing new was given. Basically, even if it had been complete, and if it had been submitted to the staff in charge of deciding what am briefed on, it wouldn’t have been valuable use of our time. 

And he cautioned the committee about being too strict about defining who functions in that role of reviewing stuff and deciding what gets shown to the PM - future PMs may have different needs, preferences, staff availability, etc. 

All seemed very reasonable, and slightly boring. 
Which is how I like my politics. || There should be no doubt that ruzzia is meddling with our democracy. This should be taken seriously whether you vote conservative or not, love Trudeau or not. This should not be a partisan issue. || Worth noting that opposition leader pp hasn't gotten his security clearance yet which is a huge flaming red flag || As a former PM, Stephen Harper is eligible for security briefs and they're certainly not refused, not when he's Chairman of the International Democratic Union, a group of center-right politicians including the Republican Party and Canada's Conservatives along with Viktor Orban.

worldnews,2024-10-16 16:35:21,washingtonpost,Italy passes anti-surrogacy law that effectively bars gay couples from becoming parents ,"Surrogacy for money (and apparently also without money) is forbidden in Sweden too. Also, the parental right of the surrogate mother (if volunteering) is so strong they can change their mind after birth.

In combination, those who look at this solution either pair up with lesbian women or go abroad for surrogacy. || I think the best solution is what the UK does. Where surrogacy is legal on voluntary you are not allowed to profit from it. You are only allowed to cover expenses associated with pregnancy and that includes loss of earnings. Also you have to cover heath and life insurance in case of complications. || Using women from 3rd world countries as your breeding cattle is bad, actually. || It makes sense to ban commercial surrogacy because of how quickly it can become exploitative. In most countries, this is already the case. However, banning voluntary/altruistic surrogacy doesn't make much sense. These are much desired children that are well looked after.

Same-sex couples are not allowed \*any\* form of adoption in Italy. Basically, you're not allowed to start a family as a same-sex couple. Probably will be difficult if you're an infertile heterosexual couple as well, given that the article already mentions that most couples (90%) using a surrogate are heterosexual. This makes me think that Italy has the same problem as other western European countries, where there are way more adoptive parents (heterosexuals alone) on the waiting list than there are adoptable children. Often, adopting from abroad is limit as well because of similar exploitation concerns.

So, we have problems with declining birth rates, and then they block even altruistic surrogacy?! I really don't get the problem with e.g. a gay couple and a lesbian couple teaming up to have children. Pure homophobia. But what can I say, the pope asked for a blanket ban on surrogacy world wide. Commercial surrogacy, fine. But voluntary surrogacy?? It's like people don't even realise it is a thing as well.

This is incorrect. The diploma mills don't actually provide a springboard to immigration. Their entire grift is that they trick hopeful immigrants into thinking they do.

*Beijing should launch a systematic cybersecurity review of Intel's products in the country because the top U.S. chipmaker ""continues to engage in actions that harm Chinese interests and threaten China's national security,"" state-linked Cyber Security Association of China warned on Wednesday.*

*The association is chaired by a former senior official of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the main industry watchdog. It published a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, saying Intel's central processing units (CPUs) ""frequently"" bear security loopholes, but the company continues to sell those compromised parts.*

*Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors used in the CPUs of computers and servers. Its key Chinese customers include Lenovo, Honor and Xiaomi.*

*The association criticized Intel's reliability and claimed the company had been ignoring complaints by customers. It cited U.S. law firm Abington Cole + Ellery's potential class action suit against the company for its 13th and 14th Intel Core CPUs.*

*The Chinese association also alleged in the post that Intel, together with other companies like top U.S. PC maker HP, is ""exploiting"" its co-designed Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) to put server users ""under surveillance.""*

*""Intel actively cut off supply and services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, a typical act of 'eating from the same bowl, but smashing the pot when done'... Using Intel products poses serious security risks to China,"" the post said.*

*While the association is not an official government body, it remains close to government agencies.
