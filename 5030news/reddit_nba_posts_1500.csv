nba,2024-10-17 17:22:56,bostonglobe,"Jaylen Brown, and Jrue and Lauren Holiday just gave 10 small business owners $100,000 apiece.","From [Globe.com](http://globe.com/)

By Shirley Leung

Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday weren’t in Celtics uniform Wednesday night, but they worked as teammates on something bigger than basketball: closing the racial wealth gap in Boston.

Brown and Holiday, joined by his wife Lauren Holiday, held court at Grace by Nia jazz club in the Seaport District, where they met the 10 Boston-area entrepreneurs who are part of an [accelerator program](https://bxchange.org/apply/) Brown and the Holidays launched this month.

Each entrepreneur will receive up to $100,000 in grant funding over the next three years as well as access to mentors and services from partner institutions including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Business School, and Roxbury Community College.

The accelerator is the first program to come out of Brown’s [Boston XChange (BXC)](https://bxchange.org/), a nonprofit initiative the Celtics star unveiled in August to help create $5 billion in generational wealth in Boston’s communities of color. [BXC grew out of Brown’s comments last year](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/29/sports/sunday-basketball-notes/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) after inking a then-record $304 million NBA contract extension and how he wanted to use some of the money to create a “Black Wall Street” in Boston.

“Sports has its way of bringing everybody together, especially here in Boston,” Brown told the group. “We know you love your sports ... but I think there’s championships to be won outside of the game of basketball as well.”

Brown partnered with the Holidays’ [JLH Social Impact Fund](https://www.jlhfund.org/), created in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd to support founders of color nationwide. To date, the fund has doled out about $5 million in grants to over 200 businesses and nonprofits.

“This is my favorite part, where we can come in and we can see people talking about their dreams,” said Jrue Holiday.

Lauren Holiday, who was a longtime member of the US Women’s National soccer team, said she wants to get to know the founders and be part of their journeys. “For us, it’s so much more than just writing a check,” she said. “It’s actually being involved.”

Renee King, program lead for the JLH fund who was part of the accelerator’s selection process, emphasized the importance of collaboration in tackling something as challenging as racial wealth disparities.

“It can’t be centered around one person, one platform, one thing,” she said. “It needs to be an entire village organized.”

While Boston is awash in accelerators and incubators, especially for tech and life science startups, there’s not much support for the creative economy. That’s what Brown and the Holidays decided to focus on — think design, entertainment, fashion, media, and culinary arts.

Applications were due in August, with the majority coming from Black founders and many from Dorchester, according to Yscaira Jimenez, a serial entrepreneur and MIT lecturer who helped design the accelerator and was part of the selection process.

“The most exciting kind of statistic is the diversity of the creator types,” Jimenez said. “We had... technology and retail ... we had advocacy, visual arts. We had just people from all over — music, culinary.” || stupid sexy Celtics why won't you let me hate you"

nba,2024-10-17 17:15:37,SpeedAdvantage_2627,[HYPOTHETICAL] Will The Boston Celtics Still Win If They Have SGA Instead of Jayson Tatum?,"The Boston starting 5 defense had no defensive liabilities. Now SGA isn't the defender that Tatum is. But he isn't someone you have to actively hide either. For as great as the Boston offense was, they do not have an initiator anywhere close to the level of Shai and his offense far exceeds the additional defensive flexibility you get from Tatum.

I would actually argue that Tatum's rebounding would be missed more than his defensive versatility. || They lose someone at pf then you have to pick and choose who you want off the bench white or Jrue || Nah they need Tatum's versatility on defense.. it'd be tough to replace Tatum with another guard since they already have jrue and d white || If they had any top 15 player they’d still win || I think anyone that says yes is discounting how much JTs versatility aids everything Boston does. You’re replacing JT with a guy that can only do 2 of the things he can do at a comparable level. 

I don’t think you can confidently say they’d get past whoever comes out the west."

nba,2024-10-17 16:42:40,Fit-Structure-9395,"Bill Simmons on the Damian Lillard trade “Miami, and their whole little annoying media machine that they have, fucked up that Portland situation .’”","It felt like the tipping point where there was definitely a 0% chance Lillard would be dealt to Miami was when Dame’s agent was calling other teams telling them to stop submitting offers and that he wouldn’t report to them if traded there.

Whether or not Miami was in cahoots with Dame’s agent in that (they probably were), Portland felt like they were actively trying to take all agency away from the Blazers and forcing them to take the Miami offer for Lillard. And that would piss any front office off.

It is genuinely impressive that Portland got as good of an offer for Dame as they did, given how much Lillard and the Heat were trying to depress his value. || I'm sure the Miami media annoyed Cronin. 

But I think they were also probably annoyed by Lillard's agent calling up potential trade partners and telling them Dame won't play for them. || Does Bill Simmons hate Lebatard? Lol || Well it helped the Celtics out tremendously. Butterfly effect from that got them Jrue Holiday and made sure Miami didn’t get Dame || Realistically, Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off. You had Herro who, due to his contract, is a neutral asset and whole bag of nothing. When you compare that to the actual haul Portland got, you see how far away Miami really was.

So from Miami's standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go."

Its a bet a guy can turn into an all star, even if he isn't there yet. 

Truth is, the Magic aren't going anywhere if Franz isn't a real #2 anyways. If he's worth the deal, then they are a contender. If he isn't worth it the contract, who cares, they aren't going to be competing anyways without a real #2. Doesn't seem like the size of the contract will really make a big impact to me || 
His perimeter shooting has been poor long enough that this isn’t just a bad stretch. The magic had to do it, but this is a risky contract and let’s not pretend that it’s worth every penny yet. || So if he turns around the atrocious shooting he'll be worth it... ok? 😐 || He could easily be. But there is no reason to do this deal now. Like if he can't shoot then he's not worth the max and he was unable to shoot last season and at the Olympics.

Plus you peg yourself at a super high number for the Suggs extension too.

Like if you managed to shave even 5 mil per year off of Franz, you can probably shave another 5 mil off of Suggs. That's a big deal when Paolo might be all-nba and get a 30% max deal."

nba,2024-10-17 08:35:21,Oceanic_Press,Thoughts on Moses Moody?,"Moody is a passable defender. Doesn't have a defensive specialty Ala GP2. His offense is solid. Doesn't have a go to attribute. Not a high volume 3 point guy, not the best cutter, okay handles, alright finishing. He's not a playmaker, and an eh passer. Not a big rebounder, or charge taker, not too many stocks. Hes not screening away anyone. He's solid. 

The problem he has on the warriors is that the guys playing in front of him do at least 2 things he can't, or do it to his level or better.

Podz has a playmaking advantage that we need off bench, charges, and takes care of the ball. Melton shoots better, and defends better, and can run pnr. Hield shoots and scores (baby klay). Anderson is a big, but playmaking and defense along with a steadying presence is paramount. Looney has defense, rebounding, and efficiency.

He's probably ahead of gp2 just because of injury and situational play. Waters is new, May not look the same in season. Moody has the best chance to leapfrog Hield, because he does defend better. That's the only way I see him really cracking into the rotation though, unless JK or Wiggs are traded.

He's a dull Swiss army knife missing a piece. || I thought he was a steal for the Warriors when they drafted him, but things haven't seemed to click since. Maybe if he had been drafted by a tanking team and got a lot of minutes he would have panned out better, but it looks less and less like he'll reach his full potential in Golden State. || Moody didn't shoot well when given the chance, but he can do a lot other things the same time. He is not ahead of Milton or Hield at the 2 spot, and he is not really leaping over Wiggs or Kuminga because Moody can't guard POA as well. Unless someone becomes unavailable or they play really small lineups, Moody's minutes will depend on matchups. At this point, just trade Moody and let the man get his bag pls. || I think his role will be the same behind a mic of Wiggins/Podz/Hield || He looks like an 8-man rotation player in this league, and will probably peak at replacement level starter.

nba,2024-10-17 02:50:29,legendaryboss14,If Kobe and Shaq stayed together how many rings would they have won?,"How would they win 8 or 9 rings when Shaq was clearly declining slowly every year? Also you can't ignore the general grind and exhaustion from a 3 peat. || the West was so good back then so it's hard to really know but the probability of them winning the 05,06,07, and possibly 08 championships would've been high but I'd say an extra championship (one) would've been the most realistic in the timeline || 1.  It's very unlikely they win in 2005 by beating the same Pistons team that they lost to decisively the year before.  2006 would be their best chance as I'd still peg the Spurs to win in 2007.  If Shaq stays then the Lakers aren't getting Pau during the following season.  And with Shaq's decline being in full swing by then, you'd put the Spurs at number one in the West and give the Lakers little chance against the top dogs from the East (especially Boston) if they are able to make the Finals. || 4-5

They already had lost in 2003 and 2004 with them together and Shaq was only going to decline after that, I could see them getting another one, maybe two  but nothing’s guaranteed || 1-2 more than what they got together most likely. same as what they ended up with imo."

nba,2024-10-17 02:22:36,RVAIsTheGreatest,Do you think the Timberwolves can/will finish with a top 10 offense?,"probably just outside of top 10 || I think relying on 37 year old Mike Conley as your primary playmaker/ballhandler is a dangerous game, and there are some pretty serious spacing issues with Conley being the only good shooter. Divencenzo is good, but are you going play him, Mike, and Ant at the same time?

Also Randle is a bad fit on paper. We’ll see if they can figure it out. The grizzlies used Steven Adams to bulldoze the lane open, so maybe Gobert can do that. Randle can actually pass pretty well too.

I would expect somewhere in the 8-15 range || Offense did not look great tonight tbh, but they certainly have the personnel to do it this year || I think we could but it’s unlikely. Ant Naz DDV and Randle are all well above average offensive pieces and Conley is still a good leader || If Randle returns to All NBA form then yes. But I think Conley and Rudy are getting a bit older so it's too much pressure on Ant and Randle"

Sure enough, that's exactly what happened. 

In hindsight, nothing would've saved them last year as Giannis went down, but it could haunt them this year if that matchup occurs. || In hindsight absolutely since he took their biggest competition across the finish line. But even if they had done that there is no guarantee that the third team wouldn't have done a deal later too || I read a Windhorst piece on this where he revealed that the Blazers insisted on sole control over Jrue ended up, knowing they had leverage with Giannis potentially growing restless. Jrue didn't want to go to the Knicks or Pacers, who made offers with more than the two picks and two swaps that Boston offered.

If the Bucks had a say, they'd have preferred to send Jrue to the Clippers, and Portland would receive the package of picks and expirings ultimately sent out for Harden. || The Blazers literally gifted Jrue to Boston for nothing || I think Jrue knew he was going to go to the Celtics before he was traded to Portland. He had said that he was going to retire when his contract was up. The Bucks may have known as well but could do nothing about it if they wanted Dame."

Just needs the consistency… || this guy needs to go ahead and take a BIG leap this season if Zo is back and Lavine is locked in this year. || Pat was one of those guys who suffered from the lack of direction after Zo went down. He spent 90% of games sitting in the corner occasionally getting a good shot or making a cut that got waved off so DeMar could iso. I loved DeMar when he played here, but his style did not match basically anyone else on the team and they needed a floor general to ensure the ball didn't stick in his hands.

Pat should look to cut way more this season and his shooting ability should help open up driving lanes like it did here. He's not going to ever be an All-NBA level guy but his game now has no excuse not to be a major focus of the team."

nba,2024-10-17 01:17:28,AmbivertAngel,"New to the NBA, looking for advice.","Missouri is right next to Oklahoma and OKC has a hell of a team this year. || Wnba being the gateway for the MNBA is wild.  Truly the dawn of a new era || Hey bud. Welcome among us! Let's break down your questions:

1. In order to watch the games, I'd suggest one of these, if not all of them

   - Streaming Services: NBA League Pass (for all games) or services like ESPN+, Hulu, or YouTube TV. Some games may also air on national TV (ESPN, TNT, ABC). Other streaming services do exist but I'm pretty sure we aren't allowed to promote them

   - Local Channels: Check local broadcasts for games, as many teams have regional sports networks.

   - Social Media & Highlights: YouTube, X (twitter), TikTok



2. Teams to Support

   Missouri doesn’t have an NBA team, but there are a few options you could consider:

   - St. Louis Hawks Connection: Though the Hawks relocated to Atlanta long ago, some Missouri fans still feel a connection to the Hawks.

   - Midwest Teams: You could support nearby teams like the Chicago Bulls or the Memphis Grizzlies.

   - Personal Preference: You might also like following certain players instead of the Teams



3. Best People/Players to Watch for Learning the Sport

   Watching a mix of star players and role players will help you learn different aspects of the game.

   - Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors): Best shooter in NBA history, great for learning about shooting mechanics and spacing.

   - LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers): Excellent all-around player with great basketball IQ, can teach you a lot about team play.

   - Nikola Jokić (Denver Nuggets): The reigning MVP (2023) and an incredible passer and playmaker, especially for a big man.

   - Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks): Known for his relentless defense and attacks on the rim. His versatility is key to understanding modern basketball.



This should help you dive into the NBA season with more context! Have fun. || Plot twist - Caitlin Clark has brought in new NBA fans as well.

JK. Op welcome to the NBA and happy to have you on board. || [Thinking Basketball](https://www.youtube.com/@ThinkingBasketball/videos) is a good place to get some deeper knowledge of whats going on.  He talks about a lot of stars in the league there.  You can watch his analysis of last years finals - Celtics vs Mavs.  Those both would be good teams to follow as well.

Lots of interesting teams though, I'm a Denver fan.  Missouri unfortuantely doesnt have one."

Steph/Melton/Wigs/Kuminga/Draymond     
OR. 
Steph/Wiggins/Kuminga/Draymond/TJD. 

The issue for the first one is they don’t want Draymond playing too many minutes at center, but maybe it could work as the closing lineup.

The issue with the second is the spacing, which could maybe be fixed if Kuminga improves, Draymond’s shooting last year stays, and Wiggins reverts back to his form a few years ago || I feel like the warriors best bet for the first third of the season is showcasing a player they’d like to trade in the starting line up. || Three copies of GP2 || I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled...  nobody's mentioned Moses Moody?

2 - Melton (or if they feel experimental with Wiggs at the 2 like last night)

4 - Draymond

5 - Trayce Jackson-Davis should be the 5 because they rather have Draymond be able to play the free safety and have a rim protector behind him

nba,2024-10-16 17:45:59,Shumonyu,Thinking Basketball on Derozan's stint in Toronto(Thinking Basketball Podcast #288),"Lowry was the engine on those teams and the best player. || One thing that often isn't mentioned regarding those bench units for Toronto is that, while great in the regular season, they were pretty dogshit in the playoffs. I don't have the numbers, but having watched them at the time, it really felt like Kyle and Demar had to carry those rosters offensively during the postseason.

Like, seriously, go back and look at those rosters. There was no consistent 3rd option to take pressure off of Kyle and Demar, at best there was JV, but he rarely played up to that status in the playoffs. Those 2 really had to carry a massive load offensively, and teams were able to focus on them much more as a result. Nobody was scared of a Patrick Patterson three, I can tell you that (30% 3pt shooter in their longest runs).

That being said, was Demar an All-Star? I don't think you could've removed him from the team and still had a league average offense, unless you expected Kyle to drop 40 a night. Considering they were a 50+ win team and got the 1 seed, I think it'd be pretty ignorant to downplay Derozan's contributions, despite the advanced stats. He certainly was All-Star caliber in SA and Chicago, so I don't think there's much debate there.

Edit: Regarding plus-minus, I won't deny that it doesn't present Demar in the best light. That being said, at a certain point you have to take your eyes off the numbers and be practical about the game itself. Who else on that team (collectively or individually) could've added another 25+ ppg? How would that scoring load have translated to the playoffs, considering that they already underpeformed without that responsibility? I don't think it would've ended well; a 5-8 seed and first round exit at best.

Edit 2) Seriously, look at the bench's numbers during the 15-16 playoffs, their longest as a team. Nobody played well that postseason, not one 3pt shooter over 33% minus James Johnson (who shot less than 1 a game), not one player in double digit scoring, the vast majority shot below 40% from the field, etc. Demar and Kyle's numbers don't look good, but that's because nobody cared about the other 12 guys on the roster. || This is silly, all it’s saying is he’s accurately rated as a guy who is very good but not good enough to win a championship playing on a team with a critically underrated point guard and depth that was elite. Nobody thinks that’s not who he is. But the plus minus stuff is downright brain dead the bench was better compared to the people they played against than Derozan was compared to the people he played against. However critically Derozan was playing against much better players than the bench units.

Also Derozan and Lowry were incredibly important to setting the culture and mentoring young guys to improve year over year. We’ve seen that culture lost (still worth it for the championship) since their departure. || Not every fart needs to be sniffed…

eta- apparently this is a “controversial” opinion and there are enough people who think that every fart *does* need sniffing.  That’s just poor time management… || For the people who think on-off or plus minus means nothing find me another perennial all-star player that is consistently making their teams worse when he is on the court over a five year or six year stretch. The fact that  people are so dismissive of this data when he is pretty much making all of the lineups he's on consistently worse over a large sample through his time in Toronto is crazy to me. 

It's crazy how strong people's preconceived notions are, people aren't even open to the possibility that he might not be as good as his accolades or scoring numbers suggest he is during that stretch."
